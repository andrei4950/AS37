\title{AS37: The Hubble diagram for type Ia supernovae}

\begin{abstract}
This report presents how we can use the "Hubble diagram" of a sample of 115 type Ia supernovae to show that the universe is expanding. We also show that the data is inconsistent with a flat universe. By combining this data with WMAP data we can also show that the universe expantion is accelerating.

\section{Introduction}
In this report we show how type Ia supernovae can be used as "standard candles", since we predict they explode at roughly the same mass, with the same brightness. This allows us to calculate the distance to the star. The speed of these stars relative to Earth is extracted from the red-shift of the light emitted caused by the Doppler Effect. The plot of the speed (or redness) versus time is called a Hubble diagram, after Edwin Hubble, who discovered that there is a linear dependence between the distance to a star and its velocity. 

The data we are analysing consists of the measured redshift and brightness value and its error for 115 supernovae from the "Supernovae Legacy Survey" \cite{SN_legacy_survey}. 


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Friedmann equation}
In this experiment we assume that the universe is uniform and isotropic \cite{AS37_lab_script}, which allows us to write the Friedmann equation: 
\begin{equation}
	H^2(a) = \left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G \rho}{3} - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3}
	\label{eq:Friedmann}
\end{equation}
where $H(a)$ is the hubble parameter, $a$ is the scale factor, which is defined as 1 at the present time, $\rho$ is the density (due to matter and radiation), $k$ defines the geometry of the space ($k=0$ for a flat universe), and $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant. We devide equation \eqref{eq:Friedmann} by $H^2$ to find the simplified relation: 
\begin{equation}
	1 = \Omega_M +\Omega_k + \Omega_\Lambda
	\label{eq:main}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Flat universe}
It can be easily seen that if the universe is flat ($k = 0$), meaning that Euclidian geometry applies, or equivalently the angles of any triangle with the sides defined by light rays add up to $180^\circ$, then: 
\begin{equation}
	\Omega_M + \Omega_\Lambda = 1
	\label{eq:flat}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Dark energy}
The cosmological constant is a special case of a more general class of models called "dark energy" models. These models are characterised by the equation of state:
\begin{equation}
	P = w \rho c^2
	\label{eq:dark}
\end{equation}
which relates the pressure $P$ to the energy density $\rho c^2$. $w$ is a constant which is $w = -1$ for the special case of the Cosmological Constant. Also, the value $w = 0$ corresponds to normal matter. therefore we shouldn't try to fit $w = 0$ to the data since we are already accounting for normal matter with the $\Omega_M$ term.
